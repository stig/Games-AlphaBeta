Games::AlphaBeta version 0.2.x
==============================

Games::AlphaBeta provides a generic implementation of the
AlphaBeta game-tree search algorithm (also known as MiniMax
search with alpha beta pruning). This algorithm can be used to
find the best move at a particular position in any two-player,
zero-sum game with perfect information. Examples of such games
include Chess, Othello, Connect4, Go, Tic-Tac-Toe and many other
boardgames.
