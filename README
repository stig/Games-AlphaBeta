Games::GGTL version 0.02
========================

GGTL exists to help people create computer games, in particular
2-player, zero-sum games with perfect information. Examples of
such games include Chess, Othello, Connect4, Tic-Tac-Toe, Go and
a whole slew of other boardgames. For such games GGTL provides
AlphaBeta game-tree search.

Users of the module will have to implement 4 callback functions
specific to the game in question.

This is the initial release.
